                        Let’s see what’s so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies play well with it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        What is JavaScript?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why is it called JavaScript?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
…There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
</li>
                    </ul>

                        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World");
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
                    </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">

                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name

                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    var x = 42.
                </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>

                <code>
                    let y = 13.
                </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
                
                <header>
                    <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.

                </p>

                <code>
                    if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                </code>
                
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
defined
                </code>

                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and Object
                    </li>
                </ul>
